            <h1>Maze Generation Algorithms - An Exploration</h1>
            
            <p>
                This webpage is dedicated to my exploration of 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm">
                    maze generation algorithms
                </a>.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To begin, I did some research on maze generation.  There's a 
                nice wikipedia page, which is linked above, that outlines a few 
                of the more common ones. There's also a 
                <a href="http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/2/7/maze-generation-algorithm-recap">
                    fantastic resource
                </a> 
                I found that has animated implementations of every "perfect"
                maze generation algorithm - that is, every algorithm that 
                generates a maze with exactly one solution. I primarily used 
                that resource for a list of every algorithm that I will be 
                implementing, but it's also quite nice to visualize the manner
                in which they work.
            </p>
            <p>
                On this page, I will be attempting to do something similar 
                to what was done on the page I linked: animating each 
                algorithm and briefly describing what they do. Ideally,
                this will become a good resource for people interested in
                entry-level procedural generation as well as an interesting
                read for those who are curious but lack a background in
                computer science (or graph theory, for that matter).
            </p>
            <p>
                And finally, without further ado... we begin.
            </p>
        
            <h3>The Backtracking Algorithm</h3>
            <p>
                Some people also call this the randomized depth-first search
                or the modified depth-first search.  The idea is relatively
                simple: The algorithm branches out in a random direction 
                until it branches itself into a corner.  Then, it backtracks,
                or retraces its steps backwards, until it reaches a node 
                from which it can once again branch out. It continues this
                process until it cannot branch from any nodes, at which 
                point the algorithm terminates because, by definition, the
                maze must be completed.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's probably easiest to understand when it can be
                visualized, so here's an animation:
            </p>
            
            <canvas id="backtracking-maze-animation" class="maze" width="505" height="505"></canvas>
            
            <p>
                You can watch the concepts manifest themselves in the animation 
                - the algorithm branches out randomly, periodically exploring
                into a dead-end or corner. Each node it explores to is added 
                to the list of open nodes, and is marked in pink. When a point 
                is reached at which the branch can no longer continue exploring,
                the algorithm backtracks. When it backtracks through a node that
                it cannot explore from, it removes that node from the list of
                open nodes, and the location turns white. A wave of pink becoming
                white is therefore indicative of a long string of backtracking.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Of course, the simplicity and speed of this algorithm does come
                with a few slight disadvantages. Like most maze generation
                algorithms, this one does NOT generate a uniform spanning 
                tree. What does that mean, you ask? Well, "spanning tree" is 
                just a pretentious way of saying maze in graph theory 
                language. The word uniform, here, just means "chosen from 
                all possible options, weighted equally." So "uniform spanning 
                tree" just means a maze generated in such a way that it was
                randomly selected from a list of every possible maze to be 
                generated. This algorithm does not do that.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite its shortcomings, however, the ease of implementation
                of thebacktracking algorithm combined with the adequacy of the 
                mazes it generates makes it ideal as a goto algorithm for
                this purpose. It's not great, but it's absolutely good enough.
            </p>
            
            <h3>The Randomized Prim's Algorithm</h3>
            
            <p>
                Prim's algorithm is an algorithm designed to find a minimum
                spanning tree for a weighted graph. That probably sounds like
                a lot more fancy graph theory language, and it absolutely is.
                Frankly, you don't need to know what that means to understand
                how the algorithm works. It's much the same as the backtracking
                algorithm, with one key difference. Each turn, instead of 
                continuing to branch of the "active" branch, as with the
                backtracking algorithm, there is no active branch at
                all. Rather, every single time the maze branches off, it
                does so from a node that is randomly selected from the open
                set of all nodes.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm dismayed to see that what I just said is creeping rapidly
                into the area of incomprehensibility, especially to someone
                who hasn't done reading on maze generation, graph theory, or
                something else related. What "randomly selected from the open
                set of all nodes" means is this: Remember all those pink
                squares in the backtracking algorithm? Every once in a while 
                a wave of them would disappear in quick succession. Well, in
                the randomized Prim's algorithm, every single branch-off comes
                from a random pink square. Instead of long winding branches
                weaving themselves through empty space, the maze appears to 
                spread like a virus from its source. Have a look:
            </p>
            
            <canvas id="prims-maze-animation" class="maze" width="505" height="505"></canvas>
            
            <p>
                Once again, you can watch the algorithm do its thing. The 
                active nodes, which are shown in pink, are usually towards
                the ends of the maze. This is because while there are inner
                nodes, part of the open set, that cannot be expanded from,
                if at any point those nodes are selected from the set of
                open nodes and discovered to be un-expandable, they are
                subsequently removed from that set (and marked in white).
                So an inner node marked in pink will usually turn white
                relatively quickly because once its branchability is tested
                and determined, it is marked accordingly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Prim's algorithm produces maze that are not quite as
                aesthetically pleasing as the backtracking mazes, and
                like the backtracking algorithm, the randomized Prim's
                algorithm does not generate a uniform spanning tree. 
                For these reasons, I consider Prim's algorithm inferior
                to the backtracking algorithm. It was fun to implement,
                but its practicality is somewhat lacking in my opinion.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Eller's Algorithm</h3>
            
            <p>
                Eller's algorithm is hard. Really hard. It uses sets to
                expand different paths of the maze, one row at a time.
                The way in which it works is quite complicated, but I'll
                do my best to explain it briefly in case you're curious. 
                If you're not especially technical, you might want to just
                take a look at the animation and then skip to the next
                algorithm. Here's Eller's algorithm in action:
            </p>
            
            <canvas id="ellers-maze-animation" class="maze" width="505" height="505"></canvas>
            
            <p>
                It works like this. At the beginning, it looks at the first
                row of cells. Each cell is independent, and each set of
                cells contains just one cell. Then, it randomly joins
                cells (and the sets they're a part of) so that there are
                less sets and some sets have multiple cells in them.
            </p>
            <p>
                The next thing it does is create downard connections. For
                each cell in the row being looked at, it randomly creates
                or doesn't create a connection down to the cell below it.
                If the connection is created, the lower cell is added to
                the set of which the upper cell is a member. Otherwise,
                the lower cell is added to its own new set, containing
                just it. While this is happening, the algorithm also ensures
                that every single set from the upper row has at least one
                continuation down to the lower row. This ensures that every
                single set currently stored has at least one cell that is
                a member of it on the bottom row.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through this method, along with a little set and graph
                theory magic that I won't even bother to try to explain, a
                perfect maze is created. It's one of the coolest algorithms
                I'm going to implement, as well as one of the most
                difficult. But I think it works like a charm.
            </p>
            
            <h3>The Randomized Kruskal's Algorithm</h3>
            <p>
                This algorithm is actually really cool. It's similar to the
                randomized Prim's algorithm in that the unaltered version is
                used to generate minimum spanning trees of weighted graphs.
                The randomized version randomly removes walls until the maze
                is completed, and I think among the algorithms I've implemented
                so far, it's among the coolest and most interesting to watch.
                Have a look:
            </p>
            <canvas id="kruskals-maze-animation" class="maze" width="505" height="505"></canvas>
            <p>
                The way it works is also surprisingly simple: First, it
                initializes the maze. Each unconnected cell is a member
                of its own set (sound familiar?) and each wall dividing
                two cells is a member of the same set of all walls. Next,
                walls are selected at random and removed if and only if the
                two cells it divides are not a member of the same set. If 
                they are of the same set, the wall is not removed but it is
                thrown out of the set of all walls, out of consideration. It 
                then joins the two sets of which the cells are members.
                It continues doing that until there are no walls left in
                the set of all walls, at which point the algorithm terminates.
            </p>
            <p>
                This one (along with Eller's algorithm) is my favorite to watch
                because of the mesmerizing fashion by which walls are removed.
                It's also pretty interesting that at the end of the algorithm,
                every single cell in the maze is a member of a single set. I
                never thought about mazes that way, but any perfect maze must
                be one set (so every cell can be reached) and each cell must
                have only one connection to every other cell for it to be
                considered a "perfect" maze - which explains why cells are 
                only joined if their respective sets are different. Only one
                path between previously disconnected sets means only one path
                from one cell to another. It's pretty cool.
            </p>
            <p>
                Enough of my nerdy ramblings, though. On to the next algorithm.
            </p>
            
            <h3>The Aldous-Broder Algorithm</h3>
            <p>
                The Aldous-Broder algorithm is an algorithm for generating
                uniform spanning trees of a graph. Remember the definition we
                gave for those earlier? Uniform Spanning Tree means "a maze 
                generated in such a way that it was randomly selected from a
                list of every possible maze to be generated." But I'm going
                to simplify that definition even more by saying this: 
                <strong>
                    A maze generation algorithm that generates a uniform 
                    spanning tree is the only maze generation algorithm that
                    could, theoretically, generate every maze possible.
                </strong>
                Hopefully, that makes a little more sense. They're 
                probabilistically superior to most other maze generation
                algorithms, but that property makes these algorithms much
                more inefficient than the standard ones.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is also one of the few algorithms that is best explained
                before, not after, the animation is presented. It's almost
                trivial in its simplicity, and its implementation was not
                difficult. It starts by picking a random cell in the maze.
                Then, it jumps to a random neighbor of that cell. If that
                cell has not yet been visited, it connects it to the previous
                cell and marks it as visited. Then, it jumps to another random
                neighbor and does the same thing, continuously jumping randomly
                until all cells have been visited, at which point the algorithm
                terminates. Like I said, really simple.
            </p>
            <p>This is what it looks like:</p>
            
            <canvas id="aldous-broder-maze-animation" class="maze" width="500" height="500"></canvas>
            
            <p>
                Like I said, the algorithm is very inefficient, but it does
                do the whole uniform spanning tree thing, which is really
                cool and also unique. There is only one other maze generation
                algorithm that generates uniform spanning trees. Let's take
                a look.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Wilson's Algorithm</h3>
            <p>
                Wilson's algorithm uses loop-erased random walks to generate
                a uniform spanning tree for a graph. I'll explain what that
                means, but for this algorithm I think it's best to present
                the animation first. I'll warn you that it can take a while
                to converge on the first step, so you can click on the
                bold letters below to change the size of the maze. <br><br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
                <span id="wilsons-size">Small</span>
            </p>
            
            <canvas id="wilsons-maze-animation" class="maze" width="505" height="505"></canvas>
            
            <p>
                Now to explain that "loop-erased random walks" thing. Basically,
                the way this algorithm works is as follows: First, it picks
                a random cell (square) and turns it white, marking it as part
                of the maze. Then, it picks another random cell and starts
                looking for a path between the two cells. When that path wraps
                around and runs into itself, a loop is created. That loop is 
                erased, removed from the path, which then continues from the
                base of that loop (which is now gone). That's the "loop-erased
                random walks" bit, and that's why at times the first step
                takes a while to complete - it's trying to connect a random
                walk to that one square that we picked in step one.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once the first loop-erased random walk reaches that one lone
                square, the entire path becmoes part of the maze. Then, we go
                back to step two, which was to pick another random square and 
                start a random  walk from there. This time, however, instead 
                of having to reach a single square, this walk just has to reach 
                any part of the existing maze, which is now much bigger than a 
                single square. Once <i>that</i> random walk reaches the maze, 
                another is created, and another once that one completes. This 
                occurs continuously until the whole maze is completed, and this 
                technique, just like the less efficient Aldous-Broder method, 
                creates a uniform spanning tree. That's right, this bizzare and 
                unconventional algorithm can create any maze possible. Isn't 
                that cool?
            </p>
            <p>
                Perhaps the most peculiar and difficult-to-understand aspect
                of this algorithm is the property that regardless of the
                method used to select new cells from which to begin the
                loop-erased random walks, a uniform spanning tree is created.
                Phrased for those with a background in CS, this means that
                whether the origin cells are selected iteratively, randomly,
                using alternating source iteration, or any other convievable 
                method is irrelevant to the functionality of the algorithm.
                Phrased for a curious reader without an understanding of what
                that means, one could instead say this: If the squares from
                which the random pink paths begin are not selected randomly,
                the algorithm still works exactly the same way, and it can
                <i>still</i> produce any maze possible. Pretty crazy, huh?
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, on
                <a href="https://bost.ocks.org/mike/algorithms/#maze-generation">
                    this page</a>,
                if you scroll down a bit, there's an implementation of
                Wilson's algorithm that selects origin cells iteratively
                on the grid - that is, whenever a path is closed and made
                part of the maze, instead of picking a random square to
                start the next path, the <i>next</i> square is selected,
                where "next" just means "first, starting from the bottom
                left." You can watch it work, and in some ways the
                behaviour is very different from mine. But it still works,
                which is one of the coolest things about this algorithm.
            </p>
            <p>
                But enough nerding out - this is supposed to be accessible
                to everyone, after all. On to algorithm number seven.
            </p>
            
            <h3>The Recursive Division Algorithm</h3>
            <p>
                This one isn't that great. I included it because I'm
                including every one in existence, but this one is really
                nothing special. It divides the maze into two sections,
                with one path in between. Then, for each of the two sections,
                it treats them as a maze in and of themselves. It cuts each
                of <i>those</i> into two, then cuts each of the fourths in 
                two, and so on until every compartment is too small to further
                divide. Simple and unimpressive, not to mention the fact that
                the mazes it generates are very obviously made using this
                algorithm - there are long, unbroken walls that are 
                characteristic of the divisions. But regardless of its
                shortcomings, I did animate it.
            </p>

            <h3>The Hunt and Kill Algorithm</h3>
            <p>
                The hunt-and-kill algorithm is in many ways the same as the
                backtracking algorithm in that it creates long winding paths.
                However, where the backtracking algorithm backtracks, the
                hunt-and-kill algorithm simply searches iteratively. This means
                that when it curls itself into a corner, it gives up on that
                and looks for the "first" (left to right, one row at a time)
                cell that neighbors part of the maze. It then continues building 
                the maze from there. Take a gander:
            </p>
            <canvas id="hunt-and-kill-maze-animation" class="maze" width="505" height="505"></canvas>
            <p>
                This one's interesting. It branches out randomly, then it
                iteratively fills in the holes it creates through that
                random branching out. The end result is an animation that
                creates a few crazy passages and then fills holes in a
                pattern that resembles how one reads text on a page - 
                left to right, then top to bottom.
            </p>
            <p>
                Full disclosure, there's not a whole lot to say on this
                algortihm, since it's so simple. Let's just move on.
            </p>
            <h3>The Sidewinder Algorithm</h3>
            <p>
                This one's kind of cool in that it's the only other algorithm
                - besides Eller's - that works on a line-by-line basis. It
                uses even less memory than its cousin, and it's slightly
                faster, but at a cost. The mazes don't have a noticable bias,
                but they're not especially aesthetically pleasing. They have lots
                of very short dead ends, and there's the obvious shortcoming of,
                you know, the giant unbroken path across the top. But the way
                it works is still kind of cool to watch:
            </p>
            <canvas id="sidewinder-maze-animation" class="maze" width="505" height="505"></canvas>
            <p>
                The way this one works is pretty surprising in its simplicity.
                First, it creates a long bar across the top for reasons that
                will become clear momentarily. Next, it goes to the second row,
                and that's where the fun begins. It starts on the first cell, and
                randomly decides whether or not to continue each time it goes to
                the next cell. If it continues, it adds that cell to the current
                set and joins it to the previous cell. If not, it keeps the wall
                between them and empties the current set, adding the new cell
                to it. Finally, if the current set was just emptied, it picks a
                random cell from the previous set and carves upward from there
                into the row before. That's why the top row is a continuous path
                - since you can't carve a path upward, it has to continue every
                time until the whole row is one path.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's not quite as sophistocated as Eller's algorithm, and that
                simplicity can almost be seen in the apparent inferiority of
                the mazes it creates, but this algorithm is nonetheless cool. 
                It's even faster then Eller's, uses even less memory, and,
                like Eller's, can create infinitely tall mazes. It's pretty
                cool.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, believe it or not, we're on to our very last algorithm.
                Some people like to save the best for last, but that's no fun,
                bcause then you have to wait for the best, so this algorithm
                is actually the simplest (and arguably the worst) of all the
                algorithms we cover. It's called...
            </p>
            <h3>The Binary Tree Algorithm</h3>
            <p>
                This one is irksomely, frustratingly, infuriatingly simple.
                You litearlly go, one cell at a time, iteratively, and randomly
                carve a passage either down or to the right. If a passage can't
                be carved down, it goes to the right. If a passage can't be carved
                to the right, it goes down. And if neither is possible, well then
                I guess we're finished.
            </p>
            <p>
                Like I said, infuriatingly simple. The mazes it creates are also
                ugly and have a diagonal bias, which doesn't exactly help. And
                it doesn't work one row at a time, like sidewinder or Eller's. It
                actually works one <i>cell</i> at a time, which is even stupider.
                Basically, this algorithm is dumb.
            </p>
            <p>
                But wait. Is it? Sure, it creates miserable, sorry excuses for
                mazes, but they're still technically perfect mazes, and that
                fact alone makes the simplicity of the algorithm at least a
                little bit cooler.  I mean think about it - the fact that such
                a trivial set of rules comes together to create a spanning tree
                (a perfect maze) is kind of interesting. The algorithm itself
                is the worst, but it's not the least <i>cool</i>. I would award
                that title to the recursive division maze, which is kind of
                underwhelming both in its functionality and its final products.
                But enough talk. Before we wrap up, let's take a look at this
                pathetic, wonderful algorithm:
            </p>
            <canvas id="binary-tree-maze-animation" class="maze" width="505" height="505"></canvas>
            <p>
                It's like... kinda cool to watch, I guess? Whatever. It's there,
                and its presence means that we've finished. We've implemented all
                10 maze generation algorithms.
            </p>
            
            <h2>But Like... Why?</h2>
            <p>
                Frankly, that's a really good question. Why did I do this? What
                purpose is there for not only implementing, but animating every
                single algorithm in existence that does <strong>exactly
                the same thing</strong>? The answer is pretty simple: More than
                anything, I love to teach. I love instilling passion and
                tapping into curiosity, and teaching does exactly that. I
                don't expect that anyone who reads this page will become
                inspired and develop a firey passion for the world of
                computer science. I do hope that after reading this page, or
                only skimming part of it, or even just watching a few of 
                the animations, you have a slightly increased understanding
                of <i>how</i> these algorithms work. Watching them in 
                progress is the next best thing, short of actually implementing
                them in code, and the latter requires experience and a whole
                lot more time than the former. That's why I did this. To
                educate.
            </p>
            <p>
                Well, that, and it was colossal fun. It was a great learning
                experience for me, too, and my first passion is learning; 
                education is a byproduct of that. I loved doing this and the
                knowledge I gained throughout the process. It's one of my
                proudest achievements in programming, aside from perhaps my
                2x2 Rubik's Cube solver in C, a project that is not yet on
                Github because I used it for my AP Computer Science 
                Principles class and I can't have it uploaded just yet.
                But this one, if it doesn't exceed that in difficulty, 
                certainly approaches it. And I think this one was even more
                fun, which makes it better. I had a blast making this
                webpage, and I hope you enjoyed reading it.

                This project was finished on the same day I graduated
                high school, and my next project (much easier) will be 
                to implement A* to <i>Solve</i> these wonderful mazes.
                Then perhaps I'll animate that, so people can learn a bit
                about graph traversal. But for now, I'm done for a few
                months. I'm off to a camping and hiking program for June,
                July, and part of August to cater to my love for the 
                outdoors. So hopefully sometime in August you'll hear 
                from me again. Thanks for reading!
